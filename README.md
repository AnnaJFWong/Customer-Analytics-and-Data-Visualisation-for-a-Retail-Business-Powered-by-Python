🚀 **Customer Analytics & Data Visualisation for a Retail Business – Powered by Python** 🚀

Following my earlier project on streamlining finance workflows with Python, I took the next step—**applying Python to a retail business case to enhance FP&A analysis.** 

This project goes beyond traditional Excel-based methods to unlock **meaningful customer analytics** and deliver visualisations that support commercial decision-making.

📊 **Key Analytics Performed:**
<br/> • Tracked monthly purchase trends across sales platforms
<br/> • Performed a comparative analysis of customer spending by product category across platforms
<br/> • Prepared data for **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** using a transaction-product matrix
<br/> • Conducted **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for **customer segmentation**

💡 **Strategic Insights:**
<br/> Both **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** and **RFM segmentation** offer valuable, actionable insights into customer behaviour that directly support FP&A and commercial strategy:
<br/> •	**MBA** helps uncover frequently purchased product combinations – useful for cross-selling strategies, store layout optimisation, and promotional bundling.
<br/> •	**RFM segmentation** helps identify high-value, at-risk, or new customers based on spending patterns – enabling targeted marketing, customer retention strategies, and revenue forecasting

🧠 Why Python?
<br/> With Python, **I automated the data processing and analysis** – making the entire workflow **repeatable with just a change of dataset**. This is especially powerful in FP&A, where regular reporting cycles can benefit from reusable, efficient scripts.

Python also enabled me to perform advanced analytics and build end-to-end visualisations within a single platform – demonstrating how **tech-enabled FP&A** can drive faster, data-informed decisions and support commercial strategy.

<br/> 💻 **Full Python code (Jupyter Notebook) available on my GitHub.**
<br/> Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook
<br/> Library used: Pandas, Matplotlib 
<br/> (Seaborn, NumPy, and scikit-learn are part of my broader toolkit, though not used in this project)

📌 In today’s evolving FP&A landscape, technical skills like Python are becoming increasingly valuable— for uncovering deeper insights, driving efficiency, and supporting strategic finance decisions.

🔄 **Looking Ahead:**
<br/> After performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA), machine learning techniques (like association rule learning using Python) can take insights even further—automating the discovery of frequently purchased product sets and supporting more intelligent business strategies.

✨ **Excited to dive deeper into Machine Learning next—especially predictive analytics—to uncover forward-looking insights and deliver even greater strategic impact!**
